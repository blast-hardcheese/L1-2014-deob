LayerOne 2014 - Deobfuscation
=============================

These are whatever notes I had when solving each challenge. Due to the nature of the competition environment, most of what can be found in this repository will be of limited use without at least a minimal time investment to understand the solution. Some don't even have solutions; those were challenges I didn't have time to solve (I spent most of my time on Made for Readability).

That being said, 4x3 is [500: Made for Readability](https://github.com/blast-hardcheese/L1-2014-deob-500-madeforreadability), which has a full writeup.
